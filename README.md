<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<br>
<p>Accepts an input called `test.xlsx` that needs to be in `data` directory. It will loop for each line and format each row removing the numbers or installments from the beginning of the cell value, and after that will create a new spreadsheet with the formatted data.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet will have the same amount of lines, the value is not being updated or removed. Only the numbers/installments from the beginning of the cell value will be removed.</p>
